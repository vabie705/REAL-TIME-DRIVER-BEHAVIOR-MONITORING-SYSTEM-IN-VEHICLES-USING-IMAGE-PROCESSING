# Driver-Cam-Using-OpenCV-Python

Real-Time Driver Behavior Monitoring System in Vehicles Using Image Processing is an innovative project that aims to enhance road safety by monitoring the behavior of drivers in real-time. The system utilizes image processing techniques to analyze the driver's face and eyes and detect any signs of drowsiness, distraction, or other risky behaviors.

This open-source project provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring driver behavior and improving road safety. The system is designed to work in real-time and can be integrated with any vehicle. The project uses advanced algorithms to process images and detect patterns of behavior, such as eye blinking, head movements, and facial expressions.

This repository includes all the necessary code, documentation, and datasets required to build the Real-Time Driver Behavior Monitoring System. With easy-to-follow instructions and extensive documentation, this project is accessible to anyone interested in improving road safety through technology.

We encourage contributions from developers, researchers, and anyone passionate about road safety. Join us and help make our roads safer for everyone!
